# 🖥️ OS Resource Monitoring & File Allocation Simulator

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Python-based simulation of core Operating System concepts**, designed to bridge the gap between **theoretical OS knowledge** and **real-world system behavior**.

It demonstrates how an operating system:
- **Monitors CPU and memory usage**
- **Manages running processes**
- **Allocates disk space using different strategies**
- **Handles disk fragmentation and storage efficiency**

An **interactive dashboard** is used to visualize system activities in a **simple and intuitive way**.

## 🎯 Why This Project?
While studying Operating Systems, concepts like **process management, file allocation, and fragmentation** are often taught only in theory.  
This project was built to **understand how these concepts actually work in practice** by combining **real system data** with **OS simulation logic**.

This project strengthened:
- **Core OS fundamentals**
- **Problem-solving and system design thinking**
- **Practical Python development skills**

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🔹 Process & Resource Monitoring
- **Live monitoring of CPU usage, memory usage, and running processes**
- Displays **PID, process name, CPU %, memory %, and status**
- **Real-time updates** using system-level data

### 🔹 File Allocation Simulation
- Implements three classic file allocation strategies:
  - **Continuous Allocation**
  - **Linked Allocation**
  - **Indexed Allocation**
- **Simulates disk blocks** and visualizes how files occupy storage
- Helps compare **efficiency and limitations** of each allocation method

### 🔹 Disk Fragmentation Analysis
- **Visual representation of file fragments and block distribution**
- Displays **fragmentation metrics** for storage analysis
- Makes fragmentation **easy to understand through visuals**

### 🔹 Interactive Dashboard
- Built using **Dash and Plotly**
- **User-friendly UI** with graphs, tables, and visual maps
- Designed so that **even non-technical users** can understand OS behavior
